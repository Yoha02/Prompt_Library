## 🎯 Overview

This Prompt Library provides **production-ready prompts** organized by technology stack and use case. Each prompt is designed to:

- ✅ Generate high-quality, maintainable code
- ✅ Follow industry best practices and design patterns
- ✅ Be customizable through placeholder variables `[VARIABLE_NAME]`
- ✅ Include context, purpose, and usage notes

Whether you're scaffolding a new feature, debugging complex issues, writing documentation, or generating unit tests—this library has you covered.

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Browse** the library by technology domain or use case
2. **Select** a prompt that matches your task
3. **Customize** placeholder variables (e.g., `[COMPONENT_NAME]`, `[API_ENDPOINT]`)
4. **Paste** into your preferred AI assistant
5. **Iterate** on the generated output as needed

## 📂 Library Structure

Each technology domain follows a consistent folder structure:

```
Domain_Library/
├── Code_Generation/           # Prompts for generating new code
├── Debugging_and_Explanation/ # Prompts for debugging and code analysis
├── Documentation/             # Prompts for generating documentation
├── Refactoring_and_Optimisation/ # Prompts for improving existing code
└── Unit_Test_Generation/      # Prompts for creating tests
```

Some domains include additional specialized categories based on their unique needs.

## 💡 How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to the relevant domain folder
2. Open the `.md` file for your use case
3. Find a prompt that matches your needs
4. Replace placeholder variables with your specific values

### Placeholder Variables

Prompts use `[PLACEHOLDER]` syntax for customization:

```
Generate a React component named [COMPONENT_NAME] that displays [DATA_TYPE] data...
```

Replace with your values:

```
Generate a React component named UserProfile that displays user account data...
```

### Example Workflow

**Task:** Create a new Express.js API endpoint

1. Go to `NodeJS_Library/Code_Generation/`
2. Open `NodeJS_Code_Generation_Prompts.md`
3. Find "Generate a Full CRUD Express.js Router"
4. Replace `[RESOURCE_NAME]` with `products`
5. Replace field placeholders with your schema fields
6. Paste into your AI assistant
