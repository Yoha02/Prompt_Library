      - Implement RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of [RTO_MINUTES] minutes for critical pipelines
      - Configure RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of [RPO_MINUTES] minutes for pipeline data
      - Set up automated health monitoring and disaster detection mechanisms
      - Include comprehensive documentation and runbooks for disaster scenarios
      - Configure proper security controls for disaster recovery infrastructure
      - Set up integration with business continuity and crisis management systems
      - Implement automated capacity scaling for disaster recovery environments

      Provide the complete disaster recovery configuration with testing procedures and validation scripts.
    notes:
      - "Regularly test disaster recovery procedures to ensure they work when needed."
      - "Consider cascading failure scenarios and implement proper isolation mechanisms."
      - "Document clear escalation procedures and stakeholder communication plans."
